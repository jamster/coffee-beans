    Welcome to CoffeeBeans, a <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> console. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/syntagmatic/coffee-beans">source</a>.

    <p>
      <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/">Underscore functions</a> are available in the global namespace. Some examples:
    </p>
    <pre class="highlight">
    range 10                         # create a range

    isNumber 5                       # is 5 a number (it is)

    size {a:1, b:2}                  # size of object or array

    keys Backbone                    # get Backbone's properties

    sort uniq [4,2,8,4,1,2]          # unique elements, sorted

    map [1,2,3], (x) -> x*x          # square some numbers
    </pre>
    <p>
      The code editor is on the bottom left. These are the keyboard shortcuts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Enter:</strong> Run command</li>
      <li><strong>Shift+Enter:</strong> New line</li>
      <li><strong>Tab:</strong> Indent</li>
      <li><strong>Up:</strong> Previous command</li>
      <li><strong>Down:</strong> Next command</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Command history is saved in local storage, so you can access past commands when you come back.

    %% The Two Aspects

    Below the surface of the machine, the program moves. Without effort,
    it expands and contracts. In great harmony, electrons scatter and
    regroup. The forms on the monitor are but ripples on the water. The
    essence stays invisibly below.

    When the creators built the machine, they put in the processor and the
    memory. From these arise the two aspects of the program.

    The aspect of the processor is the active substance. It is called
    Control. The aspect of the memory is the passive substance. It is
    called Data.

    Data is made of merely bits, yet it takes complex forms. Control
    consists only of simple instructions, yet it performs difficult
    tasks. From the small and trivial, the large and complex arise.

    The program source is Data. Control arises from it. The Control
    proceeds to create new Data. The one is born from the other, the
    other is useless without the one. This is the harmonious cycle of
    Data and Control.

    Of themselves, Data and Control are without structure. The programmers
    of old moulded their programs out of this raw substance. Over time,
    the amorphous Data has crystallised into data types, and the chaotic
    Control was restricted into control structures and functions.


    %% Progression

    A beginning programmer writes his programs like an ant builds her
    hill, one piece at a time, without thought for the bigger structure.
    His programs will be like loose sand. They may stand for a while, but
    growing too big they fall apart{Referring to the danger of internal
    inconsistency and duplicated structure in unorganised code.}.

    Realising this problem, the programmer will start to spend a lot of
    time thinking about structure. His programs will be rigidly
    structured, like rock sculptures. They are solid, but when they must
    change, violence must be done to them{Referring to the fact that
    structure tends to put restrictions on the evolution of a program.}.

    The master programmer knows when to apply structure and when to leave
    things in their simple form. His programs are like clay, solid yet
    malleable.


    %% Language

    When a programming language is created, it is given syntax and
    semantics. The syntax describes the form of the program, the semantics
    describe the function. When the syntax is beautiful and the semantics
    are clear, the program will be like a stately tree. When the syntax is
    clumsy and the semantics confusing, the program will be like a bramble
    bush.

    Tzu-ssu was asked to write a program in the language called Java,
    which takes a very primitive approach to functions. Every morning, as
    he sat down in front of his computer, he started complaining. All day
    he cursed, blaming the language for all that went wrong. Fu-Tzu
    listened for a while, and then reproached him, saying 'Every language
    has its own way. Follow its form, do not try to program as if you
    were using another language.'
